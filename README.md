This what the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number), expressed as special case of [Cauchy's integral formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula)

$$ n(\gamma ,a) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\gamma}^{}\frac{1}{z-a}dz $$

looks like on non-closed loops, with complex numbers mapped to a hue-luminance space.
